Literature Review
I know it is the winter session, but my analysis is on the World Bank. Established in 1944, the World Bank is a prominent institution with a goal to help solve poverty and push sustainable development. A fundamental  operation revolves around the collection and the spreading of statistical data from countries around the world. This literature review provides a detailed exploration of the importance of the World Bank's interest in country-level statistics. The way the country completes this task is by utilizing a grand approach by collaborating with other statistical offices and international organizations. Doing so ensures the reliability and comparability of the massive data. This organization of data is very important. It allows detailed analyses and the finding of global trends over different time periods. The purpose of the statistical data gathered by the World Bank is multifaceted, impacting various parts of socio-economic development. First, the data helps play an important role in making rules for the world. It also serves as a book of information for governments and policymakers to make informed decisions.  It allows assessment of policies and contributes to the creation of developmental strategies.  Furthermore, this statistical guide aids in the allocation of investments and aid. Investors, aid organizations, and development partners utilize the World Bank statistics to evaluate the economic conditions of countries, helping make the direct allocation of resources to areas where they are most needed. Moreover, the World Bank's statistical data serves an important function in evaluating processes. By giving a detailed look to track progress toward development goals, the World Bank contributes to many interventions of people. The ability to follow trends and evaluate the effectiveness of policies that have been put in place is critical in adjusting strategies to address emerging challenges and capitalize on new opportunities in the evolving landscape of global development.
Introduction to the Data
In conducting my analysis, I am utilizing a combination of pre-existing data provided by the World Bank, and data I personally gathered. The World Bank data offered a comprehensive overview, encompassing various factors and statistics pertaining to each country, such as income levels, population size, aid distribution, and climatic conditions. However, to ensure a clearer and more organized dataset, I proactively sought additional data directly from the World Bank, emphasizing updated statistics for a more current perspective. This self-sourced data is intended to enhance the clarity and organization of the information, facilitating a more precise examination of specific variables. I deliberately selected variables that I believe serve as potential influential factors, and these will be detailed in the methodology section. By combining the broader insights from the World Bank's dataset with the more refined and current information I gathered independently, I aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis that sheds light on factors influencing life expectancy. This multifaceted approach allows for a nuanced exploration of the relationships between various variables and life expectancy trends on a global scale.
Research objectives
Firstly, I aim to investigate whether there is a disparity in life expectancy between males and females. Understanding which gender tends to live longer is crucial, as it opens the door for further exploration into the factors influencing this discrepancy. Secondly, my focus is on identifying the various factors that may impact a country's overall life expectancy. The factors I am using are gross national income, national disasters, and epidemics. This inquiry is significant because it provides insights into ways to enhance and extend the lifespan of a population. Since most of my analysis will be done comparing the data to males, I want to see how much different the numbers are going to be when comparing gross national income. This will allow me to see if there is a difference in males and females when it comes to money coming in.
Method
 	To address my first research question pertaining to disparities in life expectancy between genders, I plan to conduct a comparative analysis encompassing life expectancy data from all states. Using  SAS, I intend to calculate the average life expectancy for both males and females, allowing me to see gender-based differences. This approach provides a good understanding of how life expectancy differs between males and females across the world.

Transitioning to my second research objective, which dives into the factors influencing life expectancy, I have chosen three variables: gross national income (measured in billions), national disasters (total events between 2003-2012), and epidemics (occurring between 2003-2012). To gauge the impact of each variable, I plan to conduct separate analyses comparing each to the life expectancy of males. Furthermore, I aim to use a multilinear regression model that incorporates gross national income (GNI), national disasters (ND), and epidemics (EPI) as variables in the equation: Life Expectancy = B₀ + B(GNI) × GNI + B(ND) × ND + B(EPI) × EPI.  In addition, I will conduct a hypothesis test to find out whether gross national income (GNI) holds any causational impact on life expectancy. This test will be executed at a 95% confidence level.

The final objective of my research tries to find potential disparities in the correlation between gross national income and life expectancy when considering gender differences. By doing this method, I anticipate gaining valuable insights into the intricate parts of the data. Also, showing multifaceted factors that influence life expectancy in the United States.
Results
In the first part of my research, my primary aim was to explore potential disparities in life expectancy between males and females on a global scale. This curiosity stemmed from my awareness of the  trends in the United States where females tend to exhibit a higher life expectancy than their male counterparts. Wanting to understand if the same things extended worldwide, I undertook a comprehensive analysis using SAS. The outcome of this analysis affirmed my suspicions, revealing that, on a global scale, women indeed have a higher average life expectancy of approximately 72 years compared to the approximately 67 years for men (refer to figure 1).
 
Since having these findings, I had conducted a more detailed investigation, looking to identify similarities between life expectancy and important socio-economic factors, namely gross national income, national disasters, and epidemics. The purpose of this analysis was to find potential causational relationships and to examine the interaction between these factors. The results provided interesting insights. Upon looking at the correlation coefficients, I discovered a medium correlation of 0.49 between male life expectancy and gross national income (refer to figure 2). This finding suggests that there exists a noticeable influence of gross national income on the life expectancy of males, a fact tied to the accessibility of resources that contribute to overall health and economic growth. Conversely, the correlation coefficient between male life expectancy and national disasters showed a low value of 0.04, signifying a minimal impact of natural disasters on male life expectancy. Similarly, the correlation coefficient between male life expectancy and epidemics was -0.61, indicating a negative correlation but also suggesting that epidemics alone may not be a predominant factor influencing male life expectancy.
 
To show these insights, I constructed a multiple regression equation: Life expectancy = 67 + 0.02 × GNI - 0.04 × ND – 9.0 × EPI (these numbers will be shown in figure 3). This equation shows the combined effects of gross national income, national disasters, and epidemics on life expectancy. Subsequently, a hypothesis test conducted at a 95% confidence level led to the rejection of the hypothesis that gross national income has no causational impact on average male life expectancy. The calculated t-statistic of 6.26 exceeded the critical value of 1.96, implying a significant influence of gross national income.
 
Transitioning to the final research objective, I aimed to find if gross national income exhibited a distinct correlation with female life expectancy. The analysis revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.43, slightly lower than that of male life expectancy (this will be shown in figure 4). This discrepancy aligns with the anticipated outcome, considering the generally higher life expectancy among females. In actuality, this comprehensive exploration not only confirmed expected trends but also provided valuable insights into the interesting interaction of various factors influencing life expectancy on a global scale.
 
Limitations
While the data provided for analysis offered valuable insights, it came with a couple of limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, a significant number of entries were incomplete for certain countries, requiring me to consider these gaps and recognize that it might impact the accuracy of the overall analysis. Secondly, there was a timing difference in the data, such as life expectancy recorded in 2011 and national disasters spanning from 2003 to 2012. This disparity poses a challenge when attempting to make accurate comparisons between these variables. Despite these limitations, the data was well-organized and abundant, providing a good foundation for analysis.
Discussion
The results of my research show the significant disparity in life expectancy between males and females on a global scale. Confirming trends observed in the United States, the analysis revealed that women tend to have a higher average life expectancy, approximately 72 years, compared to approximately 67 years for men. Moving to socio-economic factors, the correlation analysis showed an influence of gross national income (GNI) on male life expectancy, showing that economic success positively correlates with longer life expectancy for males. However, the low correlation with national disasters and the negative correlation with epidemics suggest that these factors have a relatively minimal impact on male life expectancy. The multiple regression equation reinforced these findings, highlighting the collective effect of gross national income, national disasters, and epidemics on life expectancy. Interestingly, the hypothesis test rejected the notion of GNI having no impact on average male life expectancy. Lastly, examining the correlation with female life expectancy revealed a slightly lower correlation coefficient for GNI, aligning with the overall higher life expectancy observed among females. Overall, these findings provide great insights into the interaction of factors influencing global life expectancy, increasing my understanding of the gender-based and socio-economic dynamics at play.
